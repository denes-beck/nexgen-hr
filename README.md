## Prerequisites üìã

### Node.js

Make sure you have Node.js (v18 LTS) installed on your machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### PostgreSQL

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). When launching your PostgreSQL server locally, you can connect to the default port 5432 with the default user `postgres` and password `postgres`. Make sure to create a database named `nexgen_hr` and the tables by running the SQL script located in `/app/_config/sql/init.sql`.

### Redis

Make sure you have Redis installed on your machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://redis.io/download). The default port for Redis is 6379 on localhost. Redis is used for session management.

### AWS Cognito

Create an AWS Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools.html) and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=
COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=
COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=

DATABASE_URL= defaults to `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/nexgen_hr`
